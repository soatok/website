    <h1>Soatok Dreamseeker</h1>

    <h2>Professional Furry</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>
        Every once in a while, someone asks me to help with an odd job.
        Usually it's something obscure, but it almost always involves
        web programming, application security, and/or cryptography.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're starting or maintaining a website or service that considers
        members of the furry fandom to be a target audience, and you're
        interested in any of the following topics, I'm almost certainly the
        person you want to hire at some point to help out (in no particular order):
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Bug bounty programs</li>
        <li>TLS (HTTPS) configuration</li>
        <li>Secure password storage</li>
        <li>Encrypting data at rest</li>
        <li>Cryptographic protocol review</li>
        <li>Multi-factor authentication (HOTP, TOTP, FIDO U2F, WebAuthn; never SMS)</li>
        <li>Privacy design</li>
        <li>Secure web application development</li>
        <li>Table-stakes application security topics (OWASP Top 10)</li>
        <li>Basic security compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, FIPS-140, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you'd like to discuss working together, please feel free to reach out to me
        via Telegram, Mastodon, or FurAffinity.
    </p>
    <p>If you'd like to contact me by email, my
        GPG public key is <a href="static/gpg-public-key.txt">available here</a>.

Hello,

If you're reading this, you're probably bored and looking for easter eggs in
my website's source code. Feel free to reach out to me on Telegram sometime.

I have a certain fondness for curious minds ^w^
